If you have paid import duty for goods received, and subsequently return the goods to us, it should be possible for you to claim a refund of duties from your local Customs authority. To do this, you will need to show them proof of duty paid and proof of export (e.g. certificate of posting) when claiming your refund. Should you have any further queries on duties payable/refundable, please contact your local Customs authority.</p>",

The returned merchandise must be in new, unused, and unworn condition with garment tags still attached. The garments must also not have any aroma, creasing that wasn't present in the original folding or signs of wear. If you fail to take reasonable care of the goods Bosie Knitwear reserve the right not to accept their return. </p><p><strong>Preparing your items for return.</strong></p><p>Should you choose to return any items, please ensure all original tags/labels are still attatched and in tact. </p><p>Please fold the items neatly in the returns packaging. Bunching them up and posting back in disarray may damage the fibres.</p><p>Please ensure to return the items in packaging that keeps them secure and protected. </p><p>If any of the previous requirements are not met we may be unable to accept the return request.</p><p><strong>Returns Fraud</strong></p><p>Any attempt to breach our return policy as laid out here will be contested by our company and our fraud prevention services will be notified of any breaches of contract. We also reserve the right to refuse custom to any customer who is flagged by our fraud protection service as higher than low risk. We automatically refund and cancel any Paypal transactions which result in Paypal withholding funds prior to completion of sale, due to the increasing occurrence of chargeback fraud in line with our right to refuse custom. We also add this information to our Radar system on Stripe to protect ourselves further from any future fraud risk.</p><p><strong>Incorrect item Received</strong></p><p>If you receive the incorrect item the customer must immediately send us an image of the incorrect item still in its packaging with labels attached to <strong>orders@bosie.co</strong> Upon receipt of the item image and order number, we will immediately post out the correct item.</p><p><strong>Faults</strong></p><p>We have strict quality control methods prior to shipment but we do request that all customers check their items immediately upon receipt and any damaged or flawed goods should be communicated to us at <strong>orders@bosie.co</strong> with a photograph within two days of receipt and returned directly to us without delay and while the garment is new. We must receive the item back so we can inspect the issue to avoid any other occurrences. In the case of an item being received new and with a fault we will refund the return shipping cost to the customer immediately <strong>upon receipt </strong>of the faulty item. We will then also refund the order in full or replace depending on the customers choice. Please note we can clearly identify and distinguish when an item has been deliberately damaged or stretched due to too small a fit and when there is a genuine fault in the knitting. </p>",
