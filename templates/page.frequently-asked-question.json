            "answer": "<p><strong>BRUSHING LEVELS</strong><br/></p><p><strong>Shaggy </strong>- The classic Shaggy look, brushed twice giving a slightly fuzzy effect, providing a mildly thicker 'timbre' to the garment. <br/></p><p><strong>Triple Brushed </strong>- Brushed three times. A very fuzzy look, individual stitches are more obscured and the garment has a cloudy appearance. <br/></p><p><strong>Quad Shaggy </strong>- Brushed four times resulting in an extremely brushed effect bordering on a felted look which inevitably provides a slightly more rigid garment. We will never brush a Shetland more than four times. The increased brushing also lightens the yarn colour intensity slightly, as it has an airbrushed effect on the wool. </p>",
