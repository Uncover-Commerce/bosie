This option is available for Harley of Scotland and Bosie Luxury Shetlands.</p><p><strong>Triple Brushed</strong> – Brushed three times for a highly fuzzy effect, this finish gives the garment a cloud-like appearance, with individual stitches becoming more obscured. Suitable for Harley of Scotland and Bosie Luxury Shetlands.</p><p><strong>Quad Shaggy</strong> – Brushed four times for an ultra-brushed effect, bordering on a felted look, this finish results in a slightly more structured garment. We never exceed four brushings, as the increased brushing also softens the yarn's color, creating an airbrushed effect. Applies to Harley of Scotland and Bosie Luxury Shetlands only.</p><p><strong>Great Bear Shaggy</strong> – A unique brushing technique available exclusively for North Sea Shetlands. Due to their 4-ply thickness, they are brushed twice in a specialized way, resulting in an exaggerated brushed effect.</p><p><strong>Multiple Garments</strong> – If you're purchasing multiple items, please specify in the 'additional comments' section at checkout which garments you'd like brushed.</p><p><strong>Important Note</strong> – <em>We do not brush Voe True Everest or Sherpa Shetlands, as they do not respond well to this process.</em></p>",

Please do not order a brushed shetland if you do not know if you will be keeping the item or you are unsure you like the brushed effect. Most people who buy brushed have experience of brushed items and know they like the effect.
