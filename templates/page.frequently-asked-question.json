            "answer": "<p>It is when the newly knitted Shetlands are carefully and evenly brushed using natural<br/>spinning teasels (a type of thistle) with a vintage (because they don't make<br/>them like they used to) brushing machine. Some people just prefer the fit,<br/>texture, look and handle of a brushed garment, but the classic 'shaggy'<br/>Shetland also became an iconic look favoured by historical persons of note such<br/>as President John F Kennedy, Steve McQueen and the classic American 'Ivy<br/>League' style, which rose to prominence in the 1950's and 60's. My family’s<br/>company who makes our Shetlands has made them since the 1930's, it is a<br/>timeless and classic style.</p>",

            "question": "How does the brushing service affect the texture and appearance of the knitwear?",
            "answer": "<p><strong>BRUSHING LEVELS</strong><br/></p><p><strong>Shaggy </strong>- The classic Shaggy look, brushed twice giving a slightly fuzzy effect, providing a mildly thicker 'timbre' to the garment. <br/></p><p><strong>Triple Brushed </strong>- Brushed three times. A very fuzzy look, individual stitches are more obscured and the garment has a cloudy appearance. <br/></p><p><strong>Quad Shaggy </strong>- Brushed four times resulting in an extremely brushed effect bordering on a felted look which inevitably provides a slightly more rigid garment. We will never brush a Shetland more than four times. The increased brushing also lightens the yarn colour intensity slightly, as it has an airbrushed effect on the wool. </p><p><strong>Great Bear Shaggy</strong> - A special brushing treatment we can apply to our Blue Mogganer North Sea Shetlands. These can only be brushed twice, but due to their 4 ply thickness, it has to be done a certain way and the brushing has an exaggerated effect.</p><p><strong>Polar Bear Shaggy</strong> - A new brushing treatment we can apply to our Blue Mogganer Submariner sweaters. These can only be brushed twice but due to their 4 ply thickness, it has to be done a certain way and the brushing has an exaggerated effect. The inside of the polo neck is also brushed so the garment looks uniform upon wear.</p>",

            "question": "Can I return an item after it has been brushed?",
            "answer": "<p>Brushing is a service of labour using unique brushing tools which cannot be recouped once expended. Each thistle (yes we brush them with real dried, giant thistles) must be maintained and frequently replaced to ensure the integrity of the brushing which is a labour intensive and time consuming procedure. </p><p>Brushing a Shetland also alters the garment irrevocably outwith our normal inventory. Therefore a custom brushed garment is completely non returnable, even for exchange. If you are unsure you will be keeping the Shetland, please order an unbrushed Shetland to try first, which you then can return if you would prefer it brushed.</p>",

Our Voe 'Everest' and ‘Sherpa’ Shetland sweaters are made from the undyed fleece of actual Shetland sheep and literally spun in the Shetland Isles. They are the ones to choose if it is important to you to buy ‘Shetland-origin’. Being undyed they are also supremely eco-friendly and it's impossible not to feel their authentic rustic charm, when wearing.</p><p>However the type of shetland you will want if you want a 'classic shetland sweater' is the Harley of Scotland seamless saddle shouldered supersoft lambswool.</p>",
