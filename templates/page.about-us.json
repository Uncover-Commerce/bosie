Prior to that, our lineage were fisher folk, so me and my sisters always grew up around traditional Scottish textiles, Fishermen’s workwear and Fair Isle knitting heritage.  From research trips with my Father to Shetland, Norway and the Fair Isle in the 1980’s, to working with my hands in his textile Mill in my teens and early twenties, it has been an ever present and enjoyable focus in my life, made all the stronger by my familial ties to it. Having a strong interest in the creative arts, In 2001 I embarked upon a degree in Textiles at Grays School of Art, where I specialized in Knitting and Printmaking, graduating in 2005 with 1st class honours.</strong></p><p><strong>I started Bosie to provide my own particular range of knitwear, knitted by our family, with extremely high standards, genuine pride in our product, sustainability and high attention to detail. Being robustly rooted in Scottish heritage, my hope is to provide garments with a fresh and varied style, committed to pure new wool, authentic provenance and the finest of quality.</strong></p>",

We are very aware to reflect trends in silhouette, colour and patterning, but above all we provide beautifully made, classic, staple pieces that stand the test of time. </strong></p>",
